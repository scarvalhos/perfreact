# Rendering stream:
    1. Create new version of component;
    2. Compare with the previous version;
    3. If there are changes, will update what changed.


# When use memo:
    1. Pure Functional Components (Functions that always return the same result);
    2. Renders too often;
    3. Re-renders with same props;
    4. Medium to big size.
